# EstMort
Code for Shiny app.  Simple intuition builder for estimating mortality (M) given number of carcasses found (X) and detection probability (g).  Uses the binomial distribution to calculates the likelihood of M values given user-specified values of X and g.  Doesn't do anything fancy like GenEst or Evidence of Absence do.
